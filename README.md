**Analysing the Impact of Gaming Hours on Academic and Work Performance**

**Project Overview**
With the rapid growth of the gaming industry, concerns have emerged regarding how excessive play might influence focus, sleep, and overall performance. This project aims to bridge the gap in data-driven evidence by analyzing whether gaming patterns are beneficial or harmful to a user's professional and academic life. The study utilizes a dataset containing demographics, gaming behavior, well-being indicators, and performance metrics.

**Objectives**
The primary goals of this study are to:
Examine Relationships: Connect daily and weekly gaming hours to academic or work scores.
Analyze Mediators: Determine how sleep hours, stress levels, and focus levels influence the effect of gaming on performance.
Identify Patterns: Distinguish between habits that lead to high productivity versus those that result in negative performance impacts.
Demographic Comparison: Compare outcomes across different age groups, genders, and occupations.
Provide Recommendations: Offer data-driven strategies for maintaining balanced gaming habits.

**Tools Used**
The analysis was performed using a standard data science stack to ensure accuracy and visual clarity:
Python: The core language used for data processing and statistical analysis.
Seaborn & Matplotlib: Advanced visualization libraries used to create count plots, box plots and heatmaps.
Excel: Used for initial data inspection and cleaning column headers.

**Key Findings**
 1. The Threshold of Gaming Intensity
The analysis reveals that impact is not uniform but follows a threshold pattern:
Low Intensity: Shows the highest potential for academic benefit, with a **38% positive impact. 
Moderate Intensity (1–3 hours): Serves as a "safe harbor" where 88% of users maintain neutral performance with minimal risk.
High Intensity: The probability of a negative performance impact triples compared to the moderate group.
 2. Performance and Productivity
Negative Correlation: A moderate negative correlation exists between daily gaming hours and academic performance; as hours increase, scores generally decline. 
Productivity Decline: Productivity levels drop significantly once gaming hours exceed a moderate threshold.
Extreme Usage: Individuals reporting negative performance effects typically spend **5–6 hours** gaming daily.
3. Well-being and Correlation
Sleep & Stress: Increased gaming hours, particularly late at night, are associated with reduced sleep duration and rising stress levels.
Statistical Independence: Surprisingly, the correlation matrix shows very weak linear relationships (between **-0.03 and +0.03**) between gaming hours and stress/sleep. This suggests that the impact of gaming is highly individual and likely driven by time management rather than gaming alone.

 **Recommendations**
Based on the data, the following habits are recommended for optimal performance:
1. Limit Daily Hours: Adopt balanced habits to avoid mental fatigue and emotional strain.
2. Protect Sleep Cycles: Avoid late-night sessions to maintain the concentration and memory retention needed for academic and work efficiency.
3. Utilize Gaming for Relaxation: Use light to moderate gaming as a form of "recharge" after daily responsibilities.
4. Promote Self-Regulation: Focus on awareness and healthy digital habits to ensure gaming remains a recreational benefit rather than a hindrance.
